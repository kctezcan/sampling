## Here we explain each file:
1. run_reconsamp_hcp.py: this file is a script to run an example from the HCP dataset. It first loads the example slice, does the necessary preprocessing, then runs a deep density prior (DDP) reconstruction, then runs the sampling to obtain the decoder output samples (x ~ p(x|z)), then runs the sampling to obtain the proper samples (x ~ p(x|y,z)).
2. run_reconsamp_usz.py: this file is a script to run an example from the in-house dataset, measured at the University Hospital Zurich (USZ). It follows the same steps as the one above.
3. vaerecon5.py, vaerecon6.py: these are the functions for the DDP reconstruction. The difference is minimal between the two, one has the functionality of bias field correction as well.
4. vaesampling.py: this is the function that runs the decoder output sampling, implementing the l-MALA method, i.e. the MCMC sampling.
5. definevae2.py: this file creates the VAE graph necessary for the DDP reconstruction and loads its trained weights and returns the necessary parts of the VAE for reconstruction.
6. definevae_2d_v1_mri_nocov_fullim_conz_homodyn_varsize_f2.py: this file creates the 2D latent space VAE graph necessary for the l-MALA sampling and loads its trained weights and returns the necessary structures from the VAE for the sampling.
7. Patcher.py: this is a class that aids in creating patches from an image and combining the patches to an image quickly. It is used by the vaereconX.py files as we do the DDP reconstruction patchwise here.
