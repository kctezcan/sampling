## Paper
The main idea is to sampling multiple reconstructions instead of only reconstructing a single image for undersampled MR imaging. This way one can find multiple solutions to the ill-posed inverse problem and can characterize the uncertainty in the solutions as well.


The paper is under review. A preprint version can be found here: https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.00042.


## Results
Here we show the results for the proposed l-MALA method as well as the compared methods. Notice the figure is a gif, showing multiple samples for the sampling methods. You can zoom in to see the structural changes in your browser with Ctrl+ mouse scroll or in your browser settings.
